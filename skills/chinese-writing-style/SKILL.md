# Chinese Writing Style Guide

This skill defines writing style preferences for Chinese content, including punctuation, formatting, and terminology conventions.

## Usage

Reference this skill when:
- Translating content into Chinese
- Writing Chinese blog posts or articles
- Editing Chinese content for consistency
- Generating Chinese subtitles or captions

## Style Preferences

See `references/punctuation.md` for detailed punctuation rules.

## Quick Reference

| Element | Preferred | Avoid |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| Dash/破折号 | ` - ` (空格-连字符-空格) | `——` (中文破折号) |
| Ellipsis/省略号 | `......` (6个英文句点) | `……` (中文省略号) |
| **Quotes/引号** | `""` (中文弯引号) | `""` (英文直引号) |

⚠️ **Common Mistake**: Always use curved quotes `""` in Chinese body text. Straight quotes `""` are only for YAML/code.

## Notes

- These preferences are personal style choices for consistent output
- Technical content (code, filenames) should use ASCII characters
- Markdown frontmatter should use straight quotes `"` for YAML syntax
